    <h1>Lesson 4: Types of Agribusiness Models (Farming, Processing, Distribution)</h1>
    
    <!-- Copy-Paste Your Text Below -->
    <div class="lesson-content">
   <p>
    Agribusiness is not a one-size-fits-all industry. Different businesses operate at different points of the value chain and each model has unique risks, revenue patterns, cost structures, and accounting needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Understanding these models helps you tailor your approach when working with agribusiness clients.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Farming Enterprises</h3>
  <h4>What they do:</h4>
  <p>
    These are the producers: crop farmers, poultry farms, fish farms, piggery operations, and livestock rearers.
  </p>

  <h4>Revenue model:</h4>
  <p>
    Income is usually seasonal, depending on harvests or production cycles. For example, a maize farmer might earn bulk revenue once or twice a year.
  </p>

  <h4>Typical costs include:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Seeds or fingerlings</li>
    <li>Fertilizers, feed, medication</li>
    <li>Labour (often informal)</li>
    <li>Water, land leasing, basic tools</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Accounting focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cash flow planning (especially to survive off-season)</li>
    <li>Cost of production per hectare, bird, fish pond, etc.</li>
    <li>Yield measurement and variance analysis</li>
    <li>Asset management for tools, tractors, and farm infrastructure</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key risk:</strong> Market prices fluctuate, and losses from pests, weather, or poor planning can wipe out an entire seasonâ€™s income.</p>

  <h3>2. Processing Businesses</h3>
  <h4>What they do:</h4>
  <p>
    These businesses add value by transforming raw materials into finished or semi-finished goods. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Turning cassava into garri or starch</li>
    <li>Making palm oil from palm fruit</li>
    <li>Processing soybeans into livestock feed</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Revenue model:</h4>
  <p>
    Can be more stable with higher margins. Products are often sold to wholesalers, retailers, or directly to consumers.
  </p>

  <h4>Typical costs include:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Raw material procurement</li>
    <li>Labour (skilled/unskilled)</li>
    <li>Energy and fuel</li>
    <li>Packaging and labeling</li>
    <li>Equipment maintenance</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Accounting focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cost of production per unit</li>
    <li>Fixed vs variable costs</li>
    <li>Waste reduction and efficiency tracking</li>
    <li>Break-even analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key risk:</strong> High initial investment in equipment. Poor inventory or quality control can quickly erode profit margins.</p>

  <h3>3. Distribution and Logistics</h3>
  <h4>What they do:</h4>
  <p>
    These players move goods from farms or processors to end-users: markets, supermarkets, exporters, restaurants, etc. They may own trucks, warehouses, or manage logistics for third parties.
  </p>

  <h4>Revenue model:</h4>
  <p>
    Revenue comes from delivery contracts, commissions, or mark-ups on bulk purchases.
  </p>

  <h4>Typical costs include:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Transportation (fuel, driver wages, maintenance)</li>
    <li>Warehousing</li>
    <li>Handling and packaging</li>
    <li>Delays, spoilage, or damages in transit</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Accounting focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Fleet and route cost tracking</li>
    <li>Profit margin per delivery or product</li>
    <li>Inventory turnover and loss tracking</li>
    <li>Payment terms and receivables</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key risk:</strong> Delays, fuel price hikes, and perishables spoilage can eat into profits.</p>

  <h3>Combining Models: Integrated Agribusinesses</h3>
  <p>
    Some businesses run across multiple stages. For example, a poultry farm might hatch chicks, raise them, slaughter, package, and deliver to restaurants. These integrated models offer better profit control but also require more capital, structure, and expert financial management.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an accountant, your challenge is to understand each layer and set up systems that capture the right information at each point.
