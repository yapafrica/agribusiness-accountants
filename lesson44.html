    <h1>Lesson 44: Case Study – Transforming a Failing Agribusiness</h1>
    
    <!-- Copy-Paste Your Text Below -->
    <div class="lesson-content">
<p>It’s one thing to talk theory. It’s another to see how accounting knowledge and business advisory actually rescue a real agribusiness from collapse.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the story of GreenRoots Farms, a cassava and poultry enterprise in Ogun State, Nigeria.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p><strong>Business name:</strong> GreenRoots Farms</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Ifo, Ogun State</p>
<p><strong>Owner:</strong> Mr. Alabi, a second-generation farmer</p>
<p><strong>Model:</strong> Intercropping cassava with maize; 500-bird poultry unit</p>
<p><strong>Employees:</strong> 4 full-time, 2 part-time</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Dwindling cash flow, mounting debt, and no records</p>
<p>When we met Mr. Alabi, he was preparing to shut down operations. Feed suppliers were on his neck, birds weren’t laying consistently, and he couldn’t explain where the money was going.</p>

<h3>The Problems Identified</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>No proper record-keeping</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales were recorded in a notebook - when remembered.</li>
      <li>Expenses, especially feed and labor, were scattered across receipts and credit notes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Poor pricing and loss-making</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Cassava was sold below market rate due to panic selling.</li>
      <li>Eggs were sold to a middleman who underpriced by over 30%.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lack of cost visibility</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Alabi didn’t know his cost per kg of cassava or per crate of eggs.</li>
      <li>He had no clear idea of which enterprise was losing more.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>No separation between business and personal expenses</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Household feeding, children’s school fees, and farm expenses all came from the same pocket.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>The Intervention Plan</h3>
<p>As accounting consultants, here’s what we did over 3 months:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Introduced Simple Record-Keeping</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used a custom Excel sheet (printed version for daily entries).</li>
      <li>Tracked daily income, expenses, and stock levels for both arms of the business.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conducted Break-Even and Costing Analysis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculated cost per kg of cassava: ₦42/kg</li>
      <li>Realized he was selling at ₦35/kg - ₦7 loss per kg</li>
      <li>Eggs were profitable, but supply chain leakage was killing margin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Renegotiated Buyer Terms and Diversified Channels</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Connected Alabi to a local food vendor network.</li>
      <li>Prices increased by 25% with weekly payments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Created Monthly Budgets and Monitored Performance</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Set input purchase limits.</li>
      <li>Tracked expenses vs budget monthly.</li>
      <li>Built a small emergency fund for feed volatility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Separated Personal from Business Accounts</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Helped open a dedicated farm bank account.</li>
      <li>Created a monthly “salary” for Alabi for personal expenses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>The Results After 3 Months</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash flow turned positive:</strong> Farm stopped borrowing to buy feed.</li>
  <li><strong>Cassava business suspended temporarily:</strong> Focus shifted to profitable poultry while cassava was replanned.</li>
  <li><strong>Business confidence restored:</strong> Alabi started planning to expand egg production.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved reputation:</strong> Supplier confidence was rebuilt as payments became prompt.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Lessons for Consultants</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Start with what’s real, not ideal:</strong> Don’t expect perfect records - build from what’s available.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplify tools:</strong> Don’t push software on a farmer who isn’t tech-ready. Paper or basic Excel can work wonders.</li>
  <li><strong>Speak the language of survival:</strong> Instead of “cash flow,” say “money left after expenses.”</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t just crunch numbers - solve problems:</strong> Numbers only matter if they inform decisions.</li>
</ol>
