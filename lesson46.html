    <h1>Lesson 46: Case Study – Poultry Business Turnaround</h1>
    
    <!-- Copy-Paste Your Text Below -->
    <div class="lesson-content">
<p>Poultry businesses are popular among small-scale agripreneurs in Nigeria, but many of them fail within the first year - not because the birds didn’t grow, but because the business wasn’t properly managed.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how one young accounting graduate helped a local poultry venture go from losses to profitability in just one production cycle.</p>

<h3>Business Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business name:</strong> HopeFeathers Poultry</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Akure, Ondo State</li>
  <li><strong>Model:</strong> Broiler production – 500 birds per cycle</li>
  <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Ms. Joy, a civil servant running the farm part-time</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Continuous financial losses despite regular sales</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Problems Identified</h3>
<p>When our consultant (a fresh accounting graduate volunteering in an NGO program) visited the farm, here’s what was discovered:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Production Planning</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Birds were purchased without a clear feeding or sales plan.</li>
      <li>Ms. Joy couldn’t tell how many bags of feed were needed per cycle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Poor Expense Tracking</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>All expenses were done by cash and not recorded.</li>
      <li>Feed wastage was common, and the farmhand often made unapproved purchases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pricing Errors</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Chickens were sold at ₦3,500 each - below break-even price.</li>
      <li>Sales were made without weighing birds or factoring costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>High Mortality</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 12% mortality per cycle (60 birds lost on average).</li>
      <li>No vaccination schedule or veterinary input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Consulting Intervention</h3>
<p>The consultant rolled up their sleeves and got practical:</p>
<h4>Step 1: Introduced a Production & Feed Plan</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a broiler feed schedule (starter, grower, finisher) with quantities and expected weights.</li>
  <li>Matched this against a 6-week budget per cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Setup of Simple Expense Tracker</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Created a paper-based ledger with clear columns: date, item, quantity, amount, approved by.</li>
  <li>Trained Ms. Joy and the farmhand to record everything, daily.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Break-Even Analysis and Pricing Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Calculated the total cost per bird: ₦3,850 (including feed, vaccines, labor, mortality loss)</li>
  <li>Recommended selling at ₦4,500 minimum to cover costs and earn a margin.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4: Improved Bird Management</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Connected Ms. Joy with a local vet.</li>
  <li>Introduced vaccination tracking, proper brooding practices, and feed efficiency monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 5: Monthly Review Reports</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Created monthly summary reports (sales, expenses, profits) using Google Sheets.</li>
  <li>Sent digital copies to Ms. Joy via email - this helped her monitor progress remotely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results After One Cycle (7 Weeks)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mortality dropped from 12% to 3%</li>
  <li>Profit per bird increased to ₦500</li>
  <li>Cycle profit: Over ₦200,000</li>
  <li>Feed wastage dropped significantly</li>
  <li>Sales shifted from panic to planned bulk sales</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Lessons for Consultants</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Know your numbers, but keep it simple. You’re working with busy entrepreneurs. Don’t overwhelm them - educate them.</li>
  <li>Structure beats struggle. Just having a plan and basic reporting can turn a chaotic farm into a real business.</li>
  <li>The best consultants are hands-on. The impact came because the accountant got involved, not just advised.</li>
</ul>
