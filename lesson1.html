    <h1>Lesson 1: Overview of Agribusiness in Nigeria</h1>
    
    <!-- Copy-Paste Your Text Below -->
    <div class="lesson-content">
      <p>
        Agribusiness in Nigeria goes beyond farming. It is a complex and dynamic sector that spans production, processing, distribution, marketing, and export of agricultural goods.
        It’s one of the largest employers of labour in the country and a key driver of economic growth, food security, and rural development.
      </p>
      <h2>The Size and Scope of Agribusiness</h2>
      <p>
       Agriculture contributes approximately 25% of Nigeria’s GDP, making it the largest contributor outside the oil sector. 
       According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), over 70% of Nigerians are engaged in agriculture, either directly or indirectly. 
       This includes crop farming, livestock, fisheries, agro-processing, and distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
      Agribusiness also fuels other sectors - transportation, retail, exports, manufacturing, and even financial services—through value chain linkages. 
      From a business perspective, it’s not just about food production; it’s about logistics, supply chains, risk management, and financing—all of which require financial expertise.	
      </p>    
      <h2>The Untapped Potential</h2>
      <p>
      Despite its scale, agribusiness in Nigeria remains largely informal, under-financed, and poorly documented. 
      Many players operate without proper accounting records, financial planning, or access to institutional funding.
      </p>
     <h2>Where Accountants Fit In</h2>
     <p>
     This is where you come in. As an accountant, you have the tools to bridge this gap.
    </p>
    <p>
    Agribusinesses need financial systems that track income, costs, assets, and liabilities. They need accurate reporting to access funding. 
    They need advisory services to become sustainable and scale-ready. Your role is not just bookkeeping - it’s strategic. 
    You can help them become grant-ready, investor-ready, and compliant with tax and regulatory requirements.
    </p>
      <ul>
    <li>Over 80% of agribusinesses are micro or small enterprises.</li>
    <li>Less than 5% of them can produce audited financial statements.</li>
    <li>Many miss out on grants, loans, and investment opportunities simply because they lack proper financial documentation.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Current Trends Shaping Agribusiness</h2>
      <ul>
    <li>Digital Agriculture: Tech startups are entering the sector, digitizing everything from farm records to supply chains.</li>
    <li>Youth Involvement: A growing number of young entrepreneurs are entering agribusiness with new models and digital tools.</li>
    <li>Funding Access: Government and development partners are increasing funding pools for agribusinesses - especially women-led and green ventures.</li>
    <li>Global Trade: There’s increased demand for Nigerian agro-products like sesame seeds, cocoa, and ginger in international markets.</li>
    </ul>
